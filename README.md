# **USGS Plant Matrix**
Webapp created for USGS to view their plant matrix data in different formats. The app takes a csv file as input and allows the user to manipulate the data to produce various plots.
Aiming to prioritize trait based data visualization to further trait based plant relation rather than taxonomical relation. Modern ecologist use trait based relations to infer how
different plants in an environment interact/impact that environment.
